# Contributing

## Issues

New issues are welcome, whether questions or suggestions or reporting bugs.
You are also welcome to contribute by adding helpful comments on an existing issue.

I maintain the project in my own time, but you can expect a response within 7 days.

## Pull Requests

Pull Requests will be considered. Please open an issue to discuss your idea before requesting big changes.

Please submit pull requests against the `develop` branch.

Code changes should follow the existing style. Lint and tests should pass:

    npm run lint
    npm run test

Don't change the version number, that is decided when the release is being prepared.

You can add an entry to `CHANGELOG`, but if there are other pull requests open then
put the changelog entry in the pull request instead to avoid merge conflicts.
