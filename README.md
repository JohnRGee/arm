# arm

Another Repository Manager

Provide convenient operations on a forest of repositories. The forest can be nested under a master repo or siblings in a plain directory. Support both Git and Mercurial repositories. Inspired by experience with Mercurial subrepositories.

Uses a configuration file in the forest and a marker file at the root of the forest. Allow commands to be run from anywhere in the forest, by searching up for the root marker file.

Terminology
* forest: a collection of repos and their working trees.
* root: directory at the root of the forest.

Other name ideas
* fab: forest arborist
* farm: forest arborist - repo manager, for all repos mentioned

## Configuration File Format (arm.json)

The config file can be automatically generated by:
* `arm init` from master repository for a nested forest
* `arm init --root ..` from main repo for a sibling forest

arm.json specifies working directory names and origin repositories for forest, relative to root.

    {
      "dependencies": {
        "TestRenamed": {
          "origin": "git@github.com:JohnRGee/Test.git",
          "repoType": "git"
        }
      },
      "rootDirectory": ".."
    }

To manage install location and command yourself:

    cd arm
    npm install
    node arm.js

i.e. setup command to run "node <installFolder>arm.js".

## Status

Pre-release. "arm init" is great for trying out on an existing checkout.

Active development on macOS. Limited testing on Linux and Microsoft Windows.
